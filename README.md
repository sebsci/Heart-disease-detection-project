This project is centered around a medical dataset that was contributed to the UCI Machine Learning Repository by Andras Janosi, William Steinbrunn, Matthias Pfisterer, and Robert Detrano. The dataset is specifically designed to predict the risk of heart disease based on various medical indicators and patient attributes, such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

The primary objective of this project is twofold: first, to perform an in-depth exploration of the dataset to uncover key patterns, trends, and insights related to heart disease risk factors; and second, to develop and train two different classification models. By comparing these models, we aim to evaluate their predictive performance in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, and other relevant metrics.
